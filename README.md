# World_Weather_Analysis

## Objective
Learning how to query APIs using Python and jupyter notebook. 

## Results
I learned stuff. I also got frustrated with my API Key for the google maps platform and have turned this challenge in without the final two maps showing the itinerary and pop-up markers. One of these days I might get it to work.
